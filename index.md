Coa (Clause-based Operations and Arithmetic) Code is a language based on Python that is heavily reliant on object-oriented programming. It supports a variety of common control flows and an extension of normal object-oriented programming through something known as clauses.

Features:
- Extension of OOP through clauses
- Intuitive language and easily identifiable syntax
- A feature-rich shell that acts as a compiler

Coa Code is also available with a feature-rich IDE dependent on Coa installation procedures. Read more about it [here]() (coming soon).
